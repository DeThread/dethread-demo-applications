# DeThread - Demo Application

DeThread is an application library that allows a developer to do utilize the power of distributed computing in the web browser. 

If you are a DeThread user and would like to provide feed back on how we can improve, please

## <a name="md5"></a> Examples and Use Cases 
We used MD5 hash decryption as an example to illustrate the power of distributed computing.  Not only does DeThread allow for users to distribute a problem across multiple bot-net nodes, it distributes the problem further on each connected device. 
The problem is chunked once before it is distributed, then it is chunked again on the client and distributed to Web Workers dependent upon the client's hardware.
