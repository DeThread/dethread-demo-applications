                <p>The modern web browser is capable of handling fairly difficult computations
                  as well as performing bi-directional communication via Web Sockets.  Moreover,
                  in-browser distributed computing inherently has a low barrier to entry:
                  users can contribute to a distributed computing process simply by accessing a URL.
